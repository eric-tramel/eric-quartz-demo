## Experience 

### Unlearn.ai

* **Staff Eng. & ML Tech Lead.** 
* **Director, ML R&D.**

### Amazon Alexa

* **Applied Scientist II.**

### Owkin

* **Group Lead, Federated Learning.**
* **Senior ML Scientist.**

### Postdocs

* **SPARCS (Prof. F. Krzakala).**

* **DYOGENE (Prof. M. Lelarge).**

### Ph.D. in Computer Engineering

I completed my Ph.D. at Mississippi State University in 2012 under [Dr. James Fowler](http://jamesfowler.net) working on topics in signal processing. Specifically, I worked on a technique for solving inverse problems by leveraging prior knowledge of correlation structure in natural signals. I applied this in two different contexts.

* **Compressed Sensing.** Sparse reconstruction of image and video signals in the context of block-based compressed sensing.

* **Hyperspectral Pattern Recognition.** Being able to detect the presence of certain materials from geospatial imaging by a novel classification technique inspired by least-angle regression.

### Internships

* **Canon, USA.** I served as a research intern during the summer of 2011 at the invitation of Dr. Axel Becker-Lakus, then the head of research at Canon USAâ€™s computational imaging lab in San Jose, California. During this time Dr. Becker-Lakus and I collaborated on topics in optimization theory and regression. Additionally, I collaborated with Drs. Ankit Mohan and Siu-Kei Tin on the topic of compressive light-field imaging, a work which resulted in a successful patent application being awarded to Canon USA. You can find more information about that work and some personal reflections in [[MTT2013 | this note]].

### M.S. in Computer Engineering (_halted_)

After my B.S. I took a short stint (2007-2008) in the Master's program the computer science department. I worked on general-purpose GPU computing -- specifically on speeding up neural-network inference with GPUs with the then-recent CUDA. It was prescient, but I didn't stick with the topic and instead rolled into a Ph.D. program in signal processing. [[CUDA Perceptron in 2008]]

In my defense, the [AlexNet moment would not arrive until 4 years later in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet#:~:text=AlexNet%20is%20the%20name%20of,at%20the%20University%20of%20Toronto.).
