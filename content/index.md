This is an example of a code block below.

```python
def foo(bar: int) -> int:
    """Returns an integer.
    """
    print(f"{bar}")
    return bar + 1
```

And this is an example where I use LaTeX, e.g. when $F = ma$, and from there I need to calculate

$$\mathcal{L}[x, \theta] = \lVert f_\theta(x)  \rVert_2^2$$
